DOM ( Document Object Model )

DOM catalogs the web page into  individual objects that we can select and manipulate 
The task of converting a web page into a DOM is done by web browser at the time of loading 

DOM is represented in a tree like structure. 
var heading = document.firstElementChild.firstElementChild.querySelector("title"); 
here heading points to title tag 
heading.innerHTML = "DOM"
